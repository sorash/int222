		<p class="indentandraise">My name is Soroush, and I am studying Computer Programming in Seneca College at the current time. </p>
		
		<p class="indentandraise">I was born in Shiraz, Iran and moved to Canada in 2010, where I started grade 8 in Richmond Hill.
		   Since then, I have always been amused with how technology and computers in specific work. All the work behind it
		   and how applications and programs we use in our everyday life were created. So I chose to take computer science
		   and programming classes in high school and got really into it.</p>
		
		<p class="indentandraise">I learned some Java on my own and developed small 
		   modifications for games (which you can check out <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1289674-discontinued-1-6-1-5-forge-ssp-smp-skorpios">here</a>)
		   while learning C# in school. I then learned C and a bit C++ on my own as well.</p>
		
		<p class="indentandraise">I would 
		   love to create applications that would be useful to people in their lives and would make tasks easier.
		   I hope to get a job in the programming industry and work with groups of people to develop great programs.</p>
