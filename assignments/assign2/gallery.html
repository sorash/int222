		<h2>Germany</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<p class="capital">
		  Berlin is the 2nd most populous city proper and 7th most populous urban are in the European Union with 3.5 million citizens. Due to the
		  location of berlin in the northeast of Germany, it benefits from a rather tropical climate, and therefore, a third of the city is made up 
		  of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, and lakes. After the WW2, the city was divided into two parts, East Berlin which became the capital of 
		  East Germany, and West Berlin, with the Berlin Wall seperating the two. In 1990, the Berlin Wall was broken down and the two parts reunited 
		  during the German Reunification. Berlin has incredibly successful technological and research facilities, media corporations and convention venues.
		  The city also has a high number of cultural venues which include festivals, galleries and museums, opera houses, and many others.
